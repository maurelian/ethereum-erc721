# @dev Implementation of ERC-721 non-fungible token standard.

# @dev Emits when ownership of any NFT changes by any mechanism. This event emits when NFTs are
# created (`from` == 0) and destroyed (`to` == 0). Exception: during contract creation, any
# number of NFTs may be created and assigned without emitting Transfer. At the time of any
# transfer, the approved address for that NFT (if any) is reset to none.
# @param _from Sender of NFT (if address is zero address it indicates token creation).
# @param _to Receiver of NFT (if address is zero address it indicates token destruction).
# @param _tokenId The NFT that got transfered.

# address indicates there is no approved address. When a Transfer event emits, this also
# indicates that the approved address for that NFT (if any) is reset to none.

# @param _approved Address that we are approving.
# @param _tokenId NFT which we are approving.

# revoked).
