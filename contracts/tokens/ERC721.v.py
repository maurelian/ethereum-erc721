## Vyper doesn't support interfaces
## But as a starting point, I converted the solidity interfact to vyper with the most basic 
## implementation required to compile.

# @dev ERC-721 non-fungible token standard. See https://goo.gl/pc9yo# 
# 
# @dev Emits when ownership of any NFT changes by any mechanism. This event emits when NFTs are
# created (`from` == 0) and destroyed (`to` == 0). Exception: during contract creation, any
# number of NFTs may be created and assigned without emitting Transfer. At the time of any
# transfer, the approved address for that NFT (if any) is reset to none.
Transfer: event({_from: indexed(address), _to: indexed(address), _tokenId:indexed(uint256)})

# @dev This emits when the approved address for an NFT is changed or reaffirmed. The zero
# address indicates there is no approved address. When a Transfer event emits, this also
# indicates that the approved address for that NFT (if any) is reset to none.
Approval: event({_owner: indexed(address), _approved: indexed(address), _tokenId:indexed(uint256)})

# @dev This emits when an operator is enabled or disabled for an owner. The operator can manage
# all NFTs of the owner.
ApprovalForAll: event({_owner: indexed(address), _operator: indexed(address), _approved: bool})

# @dev Returns the number of NFTs owned by `_owner`. NFTs assigned to the zero address are
# considered invalid, and this function throws for queries about the zero address.
# @param _owner Address for whom to query the balance.
